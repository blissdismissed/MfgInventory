Manufacturing Inventory System

This web application is to provide a way for a manufacturing company to manage its inventory, orders, and customers.

It is build using NodeJS and Express, and uses a NoSQL backend with MongoDB.

The application is mobile first for customers and desktop first for admin users.
There is authentication and authorization built-in, allowing the admin users to modify access to customers.

Much of the functionality of the pages utilizes Ajax requests to update, fetch, and submit database changes, while not needing to reload or redirect the page.

This web application is currently in development.
